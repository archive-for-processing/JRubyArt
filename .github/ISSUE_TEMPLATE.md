### Before you file an issue

Please check your configuration `~/jruby_art/config.yml`, if you get the following error (_or similar_)
```bash
LoadError: load error: C:/jruby-9.1.15.0/lib/ruby/gems/shared/gems/jruby_art-1.4.6/lib/jruby_art/app --java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: processing/core/PApplet
```
It means the program can't find the processing root and you should make sure that
```bash
PROCESSING_ROOT: /home/tux/processing-3.4
```
matches your system (_typical linux shown above for user tux_) for windows it may be safer to use quoted string, especially if you have spaces in your path.
